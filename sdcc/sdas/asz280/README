   Replacement for 'asz80', or parallel 'asz280'
   
   'asz280' is a drop-in replacement for 'asz80' since it
   can assemble all .z80 source code.
   
   The 'undocumented' instruction set may not be complete.
   It is a bad idea to use them anyway.
   
   The "./linux/build/makefile" is a copy of the 5.20 
   Makefile for all the assemblers, with the "asz280"
   make appended.
   
   Beware of the Makefile in the asz280 directory.  It is a
   residue of the 5.10 makefile, with a lot of edits, hacks,
   and deletions.  The only things useful are:
   
   	make all	# which references 'make.incl'
   			# and which uses the makefile
   			# in the 5.20 hierarchy
   			
   	make test	# assembles the 'tz280.asm' file
