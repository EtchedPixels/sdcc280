    ASxxxx Cross Assemblers, Version 3.00, May 2000. The  ASxxxx
assemblers are a series of microprocessor assemblers written in the
C programming language.  This  collection contains cross assemblers
for the 6800(6802/6808), 6801(hd6303), 6804,  6805,  68HC08,  6809,
68HC11, 68HC12, 68HC16, 8051, 8085(8080), z80(hd64180), H8/3xx,
DS8xCxxx and 6500  series  microprocessors.  The  companion program
ASLINK is a relocating linker supporting all the cross assemblers.
The  assemblers  and  linker have been tested using GCC 2.7.2
with LINUX, Symantec C/C++ V6.1/V7.2, DJGPP (GCC 2.8.1) and  VC6
with  MS-DOS/Windows  3.x/95/98.   Complete  source code and
documentation for the assemblers and linker is included  with  the
distribution.   Additionally,  test  code for each assembler and
several microprocessor monitors ( ASSIST05 for the 6805,  MONDEB
and ASSIST09 for the 6809, and BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811) are
included as working examples of use of these assemblers.  


Special requirements: None.
