<P>I joined the
<a href="http://cnr2.kent.edu/"> Physics Department</a> at
<a href="http://www.kent.edu/"> Kent State University</a>
in January of 1976 as the staff electronics engineer. Since
then I have been involved with the development of data-acquisition
systems (mostly PDP-11) for neutron time-of-flight spectrometry,
nuclear magnetic resonance, AC calorimetry, x-ray spectroscopy,
and light scattering in the
<a href="http://cnr2.kent.edu/">
Physics Department</a> and the
<a href="http://phoenix.kent.edu/Kent/Dept/LCI.html/">
Liquid Crystal Institute</a>.</P>

<P>Additional instrumentation development included many NIM
(Nuclear Instrument Module) high-speed analog and digital instruments:
350 MHz display scalers, analog fanout and summing modules, AND/NAND and
OR/NOR logic modules, neutron-gamma pulse-shape discriminator systems,
and a photomultiplier tube stabilization system using pulsed blue
light emitting diodes. Other instrumentation include three photon counting
time correlators with acquisition bin widths from 20 nanoseconds to seconds,
graphic display and plotting systems, and an array processor for nuclear
spectrometry data with a throughput of 128M operations per second
(built in 1982) for realtime histogram construction.<P>

<P>A personal project begun in 1976 is perhaps my most ambitious:
the design of a general purpose mini-computer. The computer took about
two years of spare time to design and build. The machine has a 32-bit wide
microcoded instruction decoder and a 96-bit wide microcoded sequencer with
a basic microcycle time of 250 nanoseconds. The 32-bit CPU uses 8 AMD-2901C
4-bit slice arithmetic/logic units wired to perform 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit
operations. The machine has 4K words of instruction decoder and sequencer
microcode. The machine was coded to emulate the venerable PDP-11/34
instruction set and used UNIBUS I/O. Additionally the FP-11 and FIS
(PDP-11/35) floating point were also coded. The basic PDP-11 instruction
set programmed in 256 words of decoder and sequencer microcode. The EIS,
FIS, and FPU microcode required 768 additional sequencer words.
This code was programmed into bipolar proms as the machines native
instruction set. The remaining 3K of decoder and sequencer microcode
was high-speed programmable static ram which could be loaded on the fly
with whatever extension instructions you might wish to implement (e.g. a
block memory-to-memory move instruction). The machine could execute
most single operand register and double operand register-to-register
instructions in .75 microseconds (3 microcycles). The machine was
benchmarked at slightly faster than the PDP-11/34 (with a FPU).
This machine was my development platform for many microprocessor
based projects and ran RT-11/TSX-Plus.</P>

<P>More recent work has included PC based data-acquisition systems for an
EPR spectrometer and for measurements of current-voltage characteristics
of high-temperature superconducting materials. These projects were
programmed in Visual Basic, assembly, and C/C++ using IEEE-488 and DLL
routines for I/O.  Another active project is the development of microprocessor
simulators (for WIN 3.xx and WIN95) for use in our microprocessor
design courses.  Currently simulators exist for the Motorola
6800 and 6809, Intel 8088, and the Hitachi H8/3xx microprocessors.</P>

<P>In parallel with the preceeding projects the development of the
"TCP/IP Package for TSX-Plus" and the "ASxxxx Cross Assemblers" has
been a continued pleasure.</P>
