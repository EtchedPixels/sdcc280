ACKNOWLEDGMENT 


   Thanks  to  Marko  Makela  for his contribution of the AS6500
cross assembler.  

        Marko Makela
        Sillitie 10 A
        01480 Vantaa
        Finland
        Internet: Marko.Makela@Helsinki.Fi
        EARN/BitNet: msmakela@finuh

   Several  additions and modifications were made to his code to
support the following families of 6500 processors:  

        (1)     650X and 651X processor family
        (2)     65F11 and 65F12 processor family
        (3)     65C00/21 and 65C29 processor family
        (4)     65C02, 65C102, and 65C112 processor family

   The  instruction  syntax of this cross assembler contains two
peculiarities:  (1) the addressing indirection is denoted by the
square  brackets  []  and (2) the `bbrx' and `bbsx' instructions
are written `bbr0 memory,label'.

6500 REGISTER SET 

The following is a list of the 6500 registers used by AS6500:  

        a       -       8-bit accumulator
        x,y     -       index registers


6500 INSTRUCTION SET 


   The  following  tables  list all 6500 family mnemonics recog-
nized by the AS6500 assembler.  The designation [] refers  to  a
required addressing mode argument.  The following list specifies
the format for each addressing mode supported by AS6500:  

        #data           immediate data
                        byte or word data

        *dir            direct page addressing
                        (see .setdp directive)
                        0 &lt;= dir &lt;= 255 

        offset,x        indexed addressing
        offset,y        indexed addressing
                        address = (offset + (x or y))

        [offset,x]      pre-indexed indirect addressing
                        0 &lt;= offset &lt;= 255
                        address = contents of location
                            (offset + (x or y)) mod 256

        [offset],y      post-indexed indirect addressing
                        address = contents of location at offset
                            plus the value of the y register

        [address]       indirect addressing

        ext             extended addressing

        label           branch label

        address,label   direct page memory location
                        branch label
                        bbrx and bbsx instruction addressing

The  terms data, dir, offset, address, ext, and label may all be
expressions.  

   Note  that  not all addressing modes are valid with every in-
struction, refer to the 65xx technical data for valid modes.  


Processor Specific Directives 


   The  AS6500  cross  assembler has four (4) processor specific
assembler directives which  define  the  target  65xx  processor
family:  

        .r6500          Core 650X and 651X family (default)
        .r65f11         Core plus 65F11 and 65F12
        .r65c00         Core plus 65C00/21 and 65C29
        .r65c02         Core plus 65C02, 65C102, and 65C112
