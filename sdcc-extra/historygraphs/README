This directory contains infrastructure for generating SDCC code size and performance history graphs.

WARNINGS:
* Reproducing the graphs takes a lot of time and disk space!
* Reproducing the benchmark score graphs requires the STM8AF board from the STM8A-Discovery, and sufficient access priviledges on the host system!

Files:

Makefile:
Build infrastructure for graphs, uses the other files.
Invoking GNU make via "make" will create the code size graphs for Whetstone and Dhrystone on stm8.
Further graphs (score graphs for all benchmarks, sizegraph for Coremark) can be build by making their respective targets.

execute_benchmark-stm8:
Execute a benchmark (Whetstone, Dhrystone or Coremark) on an STM8AF board and report the results line.

*.p:
gnuplot command files togenerate graphs from data files.
