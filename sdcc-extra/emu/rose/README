Simple Z80 processor emulator with console output
-------------------------------------------------

This hack doesn't deserve a real name at the moment :) Rose is the name
of another related project.

This is a very simple Z80 emulator which emulates a system with 64kb
of RAM and a character based write only terminal designed to help me
port sdcc.  It uses the Z80 core from the ZX Spectrum Emulator
'Jasper':

My additions are covered by the GPL.  Unfortunatly Jasper doesnt have a
license explicitly attached to it.

Enough said.
