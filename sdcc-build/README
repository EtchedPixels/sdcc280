sdcc-build - A set of Makefiles that build sdcc and any port specific parts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Hope 2001

The purpose of these makefiles is to provide a point for combining all
the different parts and modules needed to build sdcc, and to provide a
bootstrap that may be used by an automated system to automatically build sdcc.

Layout
 * Base directories
    o lib - Port and component inspecific files.
    o components - Makefiles for major pieces, for example sdcc or
external libraries.
    o local - Makefiles that are machine and/or user specific. Used
to override the defaults.

 * Build time directories
    o orig - Original copies of the source code as fetched from svn or
local copies.
    o src - Build time copies of the source code.
    o build - Output directory.
    o tmp - temporary directory for building the documentation

Assumes a Debian GNU/Linux like system, having at least svn and GNU
make.  maccer requires doc++ (http://docpp.sourceforge.net/).
