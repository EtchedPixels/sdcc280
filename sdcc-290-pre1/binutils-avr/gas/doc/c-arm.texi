@cindex @code{-marm} command line option, ARM
@item -marm [@var{2}|@var{250}|@var{3}|@var{6}|@var{60}|@var{600}|@var{610}|@var{620}|@var{7}|@var{7m}|@var{7d}|@var{7dm}|@var{7di}|@var{7dmi}|@var{70}|@var{700}|@var{700i}|@var{710}|@var{710c}|@var{7100}|@var{7500}|@var{7500fe}|@var{7tdmi}|@var{8}|@var{810}|@var{9}|@var{9tdmi}|@var{920}|@var{strongarm}|@var{strongarm110}|@var{strongarm1100}]

error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which
will not execute on the target processor.
@cindex @code{-marmv} command line option, ARM
@item -marmv [@var{2}|@var{2a}|@var{3}|@var{3m}|@var{4}|@var{4t}|@var{5}|@var{5t}]
This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will issue
an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which
will not execute on the target architecture.
@cindex @code{-mthumb} command line option, ARM
@item -mthumb
This option specifies that only Thumb instructions should be assembled.
@cindex @code{-mall} command line option, ARM
@item -mall
This option specifies that any Arm or Thumb instruction should be assembled.
@cindex @code{-mfpa} command line option, ARM
@item -mfpa [@var{10}|@var{11}]
This option specifies the floating point architecture in use on the
target processor. 
@cindex @code{-mfpe-old} command line option, ARM
@item -mfpe-old
Do not allow the assemble of floating point multiple instructions.
@cindex @code{-mno-fpu} command line option, ARM
@item -mno-fpu

@cindex @code{-mthumb-interwork} command line option, ARM
@item -mthumb-interwork
This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should
be marked as supporting interworking.
@cindex @code{-mapcs} command line option, ARM
@item -mapcs [@var{26}|@var{32}]
This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should
be marked as supporting the indicated version of the Arm Procedure.
Calling Standard.
@item -mapcs-float
This indicates the the floating point variant of the APCS should be
used.  In this variant floating point arguments are passed in FP
registers ratehr than integer registers.
@item -mapcs-reentrant
This indicates that the reentrant variant of the APCS should be used.
This variant supports position independent code.
@cindex @code{-EB} command line option, ARM
@item -EB
This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should
be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.
@cindex @code{-EL} command line option, ARM
@item -EL
This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should
be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.
@cindex @code{-k} command line option, ARM
@cindex PIC code generation for ARM
@item -k
This option enables the generation of PIC (position independent code).
@item -moabi
This indicates that the code should be assembled using the old ARM ELF
conventions, based on a beta release release of the ARM-ELF
specifications, rather than the default conventions which are based on
the final release of the ARM-ELF specifications.

@node ARM Directives
@section ARM Machine Directives

@cindex machine directives, ARM
@cindex ARM machine directives
@table @code

@cindex @code{req} directive, ARM
@item @var{name} .req @var{register name}
This creates an alias for @var{register name} called @var{name}.  For
example:

@smallexample
        foo .req r0
@end smallexample

@cindex @code{code} directive, ARM
@item .code [@var{16}|@var{32}]
This directive selects the instruction set being generated. The value 16
selects Thumb, with the value 32 selecting ARM.

@cindex @code{thumb} directive, ARM
@item .thumb
This performs the same action as @var{.code 16}.

@cindex @code{arm} directive, ARM
@item .arm
This performs the same action as @var{.code 32}.

@cindex @code{force_thumb} directive, ARM
@item .force_thumb
This directive forces the selection of Thumb instructions, even if the
target processor does not support those instructions

@cindex @code{thumb_func} directive, ARM
@item .thumb_func
This directive specifies that the following symbol is the name of a
Thumb encoded function.  This information is necessary in order to allow
the assembler and linker to generate correct code for interworking
between Arm and Thumb instructions and should be used even if
interworking is not going to be performed.

@cindex @code{thumb_set} directive, ARM
@item .thumb_set
This performs the equivalent of a @code{.set} directive in that it
creates a symbol which is an alias for another symbol (possibly not yet
defined).  This directive also has the added property in that it marks
the aliased symbol as being a thumb function entry point, in the same
way that the @code{.thumb_func} directive does.

@cindex @code{.ltorg} directive, ARM
@item .ltorg
This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to be
dumped into the current section (which is assumed to be the .text
section) at the current location (aligned to a word boundary).

@cindex @code{.pool} directive, ARM
@item .pool
This is a synonym for .ltorg.

@end table

@node ARM Opcodes
@section Opcodes

@cindex ARM opcodes
@cindex opcodes for ARM
@code{@value{AS}} implements all the standard ARM opcodes.  It also
implements several pseudo opcodes, including several synthetic load
instructions. 

@table @code

@cindex @code{NOP} pseudo op, ARM
@item NOP
@smallexample
  nop
@end smallexample

This pseudo op will always evaluate to a legal ARM instruction that does
nothing.  Currently it will evaluate to MOV r0, r0.

@cindex @code{LDR reg,=<label>} pseudo op, ARM
@item LDR 
@smallexample
  ldr <register> , = <expression>
@end smallexample

If expression evaluates to a numeric constant then a MOV or MVN
instruction will be used in place of the LDR instruction, if the
constant can be generated by either of these instructions.  Otherwise
the constant will be placed into the nearest literal pool (if it not
already there) and a PC relative LDR instruction will be generated.

@cindex @code{ADR reg,<label>} pseudo op, ARM
@item ADR
@smallexample
  adr <register> <label>
@end smallexample

This instruction will load the address of @var{label} into the indicated
register.  The instruction will evaluate to a PC relative ADD or SUB
instruction depending upon where the label is located.  If the label is
out of range, or if it is not defined in the same file (and section) as
the ADR instruction, then an error will be generated.  This instruction
will not make use of the literal pool.

@cindex @code{ADRL reg,<label>} pseudo op, ARM
@item ADRL 
@smallexample
  adrl <register> <label>
@end smallexample

This instruction will load the address of @var{label} into the indicated
register.  The instruction will evaluate to one or two a PC relative ADD
or SUB instructions depending upon where the label is located.  If a
second instruction is not needed a NOP instruction will be generated in
its place, so that this instruction is always 8 bytes long.

If the label is out of range, or if it is not defined in the same file
(and section) as the ADRL instruction, then an error will be generated.
This instruction will not make use of the literal pool.
