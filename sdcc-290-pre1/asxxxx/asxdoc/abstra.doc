        Abstract:  

           The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assem-
        blers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
        contains cross assemblers for the 6800(6802/6808), 6801(hd6303),
        6804,  6805,  68HC08,  6809,  68HC11,  68HC12,   68HC16,   8051,
        8085(8080),  z80(hd64180),  H8/3xx,  DS8xCxxx  and  6500  series
        microprocessors.  Each assembler has a device  specific  section
        which  includes:   (1)  device description, byte order, and file
        extension information, (2) a table of assembler  general  direc-
        tives,  special  directives,  assembler mnemonics and associated
        operation codes, (3) machine specific code  for  processing  the
        device mnemonics, addressing modes, and special directives.  

           The assemblers have a common device independent section which
        handles the details of file input/output, symbol  table  genera-
        tion,  program/data  areas,  expression  analysis, and assembler
        directive processing.  

           The  assemblers  provide  the following features:  (1) alpha-
        betized, formatted symbol table listings, (2) relocatable object
        modules, (3) global symbols for linking object modules, (4) con-
        ditional assembly directives, (5) reusable  local  symbols,  and
        (6) include-file processing.  

           The  companion program ASLINK is a relocating linker perform-
        ing the following functions:  (1) bind multiple  object  modules
        into  a  single  memory  image,  (2) resolve inter-module symbol
        references,  (3)  resolve  undefined  symbols   from   specified
        librarys of object modules, (4) process absolute, relative, con-
        catenated, and overlay attributes in data and program  sections,
        (5)  perform  byte and word program-counter relative (pc or pcr)
        addressing calculations, (6) define absolute  symbol  values  at
        link  time, (7) define absolute area base address values at link
        time, (8) produce Intel Hex or Motorola S  record  output  file,
        (9)  produce  a  map of the linked memory image, and (10) update
        the ASxxxx assembler listing files with the absolute linked  ad-
        dresses and data.  

           The  assemblers  and  linker have been tested using GCC 2.7.2
        with LINUX, Symantec C/C++ V6.1/V7.2, DJGPP (GCC 2.8.1) and  VC6
        with  MS-DOS/Windows  3.x/95/98.   Complete  source code and do-
        cumentation for the assemblers and linker is included  with  the
        distribution.   Additionally,  test  code for each assembler and
        several microprocessor monitors ( ASSIST05 for the 6805,  MONDEB
        and ASSIST09 for the 6809, and BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811) are in-
        cluded as working examples of use of these assemblers.
