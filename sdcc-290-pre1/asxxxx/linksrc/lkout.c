 *      Record Mark Field    -  This  field  signifies  the  start  of a
 *                              record, and consists of an  ascii  colon
 *                              (:).
 *
 *      Record Length Field  -  This   field   consists   of  two  ascii
 *                              characters which indicate the number  of
 *                              data   bytes   in   this   record.   The
 *                              characters are the result of  converting
 *                              the  number  of  bytes  in binary to two
 *                              ascii characters, high digit first.   An
 *                              End  of  File  record contains two ascii
 *                              zeros in this field.
 *
 *      Load Address Field   -  This  field  consists  of the four ascii
 *                              characters which result from  converting
 *                              the  the  binary value of the address in
 *                              which to begin loading this record.  The
 *                              order is as follows:
 *
 *                                  High digit of high byte of address.
 *                                  Low digit of high byte of address.
 *                                  High digit of low byte of address.
 *                                  Low digit of low byte of address.
 *
 *                              In an End of File record this field con-
 *                              sists of either four ascii zeros or  the
 *                              program  entry  address.   Currently the
 *                              entry address option is not supported.
 *
 *      Record Type Field    -  This  field  identifies the record type,
 *                              which is either 0 for data records,  1
 *                              for an End of File record,  or 4 for a
 *				segment record.  It consists
 *                              of two ascii characters, with  the  high
 *                              digit of the record type first, followed
 *                              by the low digit of the record type.
 *
 *      Data Field           -  This  field consists of the actual data,
 *                              converted to two ascii characters,  high
 *                              digit first.  There are no data bytes in
 *                              the End of File record.
 *
 *      Checksum Field       -  The  checksum  field is the 8 bit binary
 *                              sum of the record length field, the load
 *                              address  field,  the  record type field,
 *                              and the data field.  This  sum  is  then
 *                              negated  (2's  complement) and converted
 *                              to  two  ascii  characters,  high  digit
 *                              first.
