          <h2><a name="What"></a>Automatically Updated Nightly Snapshots</h2>
          <p>
These snapshots are automatically updated from the developmental
code in the Subversion repository.  They are <i>not</i> official releases
and should be considered "beta" quality.  Some may not even work
at all if a serious bug was introduced during development, so
several are provided to give you the best chance of finding one
that will work.
          </p>
          <p>
Because official SDCC releases are infrequent, these snapshots
often contain fixes for bugs discovered in the last official
release.  If you do encounter a bug, please test the latest
snapshot build to see if it has already been fixed by a developer.
          </p>
